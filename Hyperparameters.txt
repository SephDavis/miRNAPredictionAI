In the given code, there are several hyperparameters that define the structure and behavior of the model. 

Let's go through each of them:

sequence_length: This hyperparameter defines the length of the input sequences that the model will receive. 
In this case, the model processes sequences of length 50 nucleotides. Each input sequence is a 50-nucleotide-long continuous subsequence from the original FASTA file.

num_hidden_units: This hyperparameter specifies the number of hidden units (also known as memory cells) in each of the LSTM layers. 
In this case, each LSTM layer has 128 hidden units. 
The more hidden units, the more complex patterns the model can learn, but at the cost of increased computational complexity.

num_output_units: This hyperparameter specifies the number of output units in the final Dense layer of the model. 
Since the problem is a binary classification task (predicting whether a sequence induces RNAi or not), there is only one output unit with a sigmoid activation function,
which produces a probability value between 0 and 1.

batch_size: This hyperparameter defines the number of samples used for a single update of the model's weights during training. 
In this case, the batch size is 32. A smaller batch size can result in a more accurate estimate of the gradient, but at the cost of increased training time. 
Conversely, a larger batch size can speed up training but may produce a less accurate gradient estimate.

num_epochs: This hyperparameter represents the number of times the model iterates over the entire dataset during training. 
In this case, the model trains for 10 epochs. 
The more epochs, the more the model can learn from the data, but there is a risk of overfitting if the number of epochs is too high.

These hyperparameters are essential for tuning the performance of the model. 
Depending on the complexity of the data and the problem, you may need to experiment with different hyperparameter values to achieve the best performance.
